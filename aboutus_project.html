    <p>How Important Is Accreditation? And What Are Some Key Accreditations to Look For?</p><br>
    <p>Accreditation is another way to judge quality. Accreditation is a “seal of approval” given by a private, independent group. Health care organizations must meet international and national standards, <br> clinical measures, in order to be accredited. We try to belong and participate in as many such initiatives as possible…seeking accreditation wherever we can.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)</li>
        <li>Accredited by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA)</li>
        <li>Accredited by the National Board for Certified Acupuncture & Herbalists (NBCCAH)</li>
        <li>Accredited by the National Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NBBTB)</li>
        <li>Accredited by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)</li>
